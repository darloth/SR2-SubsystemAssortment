S_INTRICATE_DESIGN_DESC: <<
	Extra time and effort dedicated to the design phase allows for a more complicated ship blueprint, but following it to actually construct such a vessel will inevitably take longer.

	[img=Plus]Internal space is half as large with twice the limit, allowing for more complex designs.[/img]
	[img=Minus]This does not make the ship any tougher, and will tend to make it easier to destroy important modules like bridges and control cores.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Increased labor cost due to longer prototyping phase.[/img]
>>
S_EMERGENCY_REPAIR_DESC: <<
	A command and control node for a cloud of auto-repair nanobots.  These surround the fleet and repair damage over time but require a portion of the empire's energy to activate.

	Max 1 per ship.

	[img=AttributeIcons::2;22]Repairs the fleet over time.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Costs a little energy to activate.[/img]
	[img=Minus]120 Second Cooldown.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Requires extra command to coordinate nanobots.[/img]
>>
FIELDENCLOSURE_NAME: Field Enclosure
FIELDENCLOSURE_DESC: <<
	The malleable hard-field enclosure is a two-dimensional forcefield projected across a hole in the hull of the vessel.  It can let projectiles, energy or smaller vessels pass through in one or both directions as desired.

	[img=Plus]High [b][color=#80ff80]health[/color][/b].[/img]
	[img=Plus]Resists and reduces incoming damage.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Enclosures on the outside of the ship do not use up interior space.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Low mass.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Does not block turrets or modules requiring external access.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Requires power.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Expensive.[/img]
>>
S_SPECIALIST_DESIGN_DESC: <<
	This designates a support design as a specialist design, preventing it from being automatically built as a defense ship.

	[img=Plus]Won't be automatically built as a defense ship.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Won't be automatically built as a defense ship.[/img]
