Subsystem: PlasmaBombLauncher
	Name: Plasma Bomb Launcher
	Description: <<
		Launches massive, semi-guided bombs at a nearby target. These bombs explode in an area around their target. This support varient of the torpedo system sacrifices almost all of the long range containment fields to fit a similar system into a support frame.

		(You will need to use support behaviors to get this weapon into range, or drop your fleet right on top of the enemy)
